## General Information
- In this natural language processing project, I will be using a variation of the [Sentiment140 dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/home), which contains 1.6 million tweets alongside their respective sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive).
- I am developing a model to perform classification of the sentiment
- In this project, I am a using a pre-trained GloVe embedding layer which significantly improve the accuracy and decrease overfitting
- The project also contains tokenization, Sequences-truncating and -padding

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Room for improvement:
- The model was trained using GRU. Will implement LSTM later.
